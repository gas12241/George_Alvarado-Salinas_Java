I wanted to say that Jessie Estrada helped a lot with this assignment.
The Authorization-service I got from the class assignment from last Wednesday
and the POM was given to me by Jessie for both project folders because I was
having trouble with some of my dependencies and I think the Java version too.

Suniul also helped me with editing my configuration when I was running into
problems running what I think was the authorization service but I could be wrong.

Anyways, I'd like to thank Professor and TAs for the summit experience. Our class
was 10/10.
